# Markdown-Compiler
A minimal markdown compiler for my personal website, written in C in a Handmade
style. Not really recommended for public use, but if you're adventurous go
ahead.. Also if you make something better let me know!

# Setup

```
mkdir my_website
cd my_website
mkdir -p public/series
mkdir -p html_generator/series
echo "# hello there\n hi" > html_generator/series/example-blog.txt
git clone git@github.com:SethArchambault/Markdown-Compiler.git
cd Markdown-Compiler
./build.sh
```

Website will be created at public/series/example-blog-url.html
