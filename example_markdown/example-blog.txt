Here's an example of a blog post!

## A section of the post

Some code:

```
int main() {
    return 1;
}
```

**bold text**

_italic text_

Bullets!

- oh god
- I love
- bullets!

# A second blog post on the same page

Do you really want a separate post for each blog post? I mean you can do that but this is easier in my opinion..

You can always link to the blog post - every h1 tag gets it's own anchor tag:
[See what I mean](#Example Blog)

H1's are all added to the navigation on the left.. At least in this template they are..
